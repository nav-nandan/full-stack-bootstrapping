# full-stack-ninja
Bootstrapping is an art and building cool stuff using full stack technology is a craft. Here I will put together some lightweight base projects that I built and re-use over the years to help quickly self-start on things like web development, machine learning, data visualization, etc. contributors are more than welcome!
