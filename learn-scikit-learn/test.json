Of course, our room wasn't ready until 4pm, although we were there at 3:50pm.  The room was spacious, and that was about all. The walls were so paper thin that we could hear people in neighboring rooms talking. The second evening we were there there was a hired karaoke team set up in the pool area, and we had to listen to four hours of horrible singing mostly from the couple who owned the machine, because no one was there participating, and by 9pm, I called the front desk to complain because it was so loud, it sounded like they were in the room with a stereo blasting boom-box. They said, they would stop by 10pm which they did, but, good grief, it wasn't like they had a captive audience. \nWe couldn't wait to leave. Luxury, its not. Even Motel 6 has a hair dryer and softer towels.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l5oUrgQ190l8CcN8uzd_pA"}

I understand there was only one waiter at the time but the restaurant was not busy and we waited forever to get our food and we had to wait again to get our bill. By the end up lunch I was really irritated with the service and felt like I paid way to much for a lunch that did nothing but disappoint me.

We still couldn't figure out why it was so empty though!!  Still, we had great service for a party of 9, or maybe that was just because I made it a two martini lunch...nothin' wrong with that!!\n\nMy cravings for a delicious BLT were satisfied....and the gorgonzola and pistachio slaw was SO good...and I'm not usually a slaw fan...but wow it was tasty.\n\nhahaha, yes!  The bathrooms were quite an experience!!!  I didn't take the elevator though...but next time I will have to!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

You're pretty much forgotten by the wait staff\n-Don't order the cornbread - its extremely dense and hard, not the soft, buttery kind\n\nI know the crowd will boo when they read this, but seriously folks - their chicken and waffles tastes like KFC chicken with Ego waffles - anybody feel me on this?! What is so special about their stuff? I say take your money and buy you're own bucket of fried chicken for the same price. Sorry!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uEJQSIjWui-TDWXaGlcqyQ"}
