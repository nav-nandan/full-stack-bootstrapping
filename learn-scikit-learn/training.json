I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night, and although it was crowded, we didn't have more than a 20 minute wait.  Most things on the menu looked great - when you're trying to eat light, you're usually limited to 2 or 3 of the more boring items on a menu.  Here, I felt as though I had a solid selection that spanned from a few pretty innovative salads to low carb chicken and salmon dishes.\n\nWe split the edamame dumplings, and I got the sashimi tuna salad as my entree.  Both were really outstanding.  The dumpling wrapper was really thin and tasted homemade, and the accompanying broth/sauce had a hint of truffle oil in it - delicious!  The salad had quite a bit of cubed raw ahi tuna with a light miso vinaigrette and some edamame and avocado.  For $14, I thought it was a pretty good deal.  \n\nAlthough I really enjoyed my experience, I can see why this restaurant isn't for everyone.  Portions are intentionally a bit smaller, and although healthy can still be really flavorful, it's not the same as the food you get elsewhere that's smothered in butter or deep fried.  I would recommend True Food for vegans/vegetarians, people who want to go out to eat but are still looking for a healthy meal, or a girls night out.  For large, pickier groups or people wanting a huge plate of food, you should probably look elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qjmCVYkwP-HDa35jwYucbQ"}

I have had a bad hankering for samgyupsal lately. He likes Korean food and sushi, so this place was a no brainer for us. Luckily we were in the East Valley because that is the only downfall for us, no decent Korean places in CenPho area. We NOW know only to order what we want so we do not over order and end up with tons of leftovers like before (not that is a problem). So some sushi, bulgogi and samgyupsal for KBBQ is all we needed. The banchan and rice came out, and we started to dig in. Our favorites are the cucumber, daikon radish, and cabbage kimchis as always, but they had other great choices. For some reason this time the banchan was superior to the other times we have came...we had to get a few refills of them before our food was ready! \n\nGrills started up and bulgogi was ready to be cooked. A few minutes later my samgyupsal finally showed up and plenty of it! I don't know, but it sure seemed like there was much more samgyupsal than the last time I came and I was definitely not going to complain. Everything was tasty and satisfying. It was one of my more pleasurable times at this place. I love that they have a Korean network (SBS) playing on the tv, so at times you might be watching a Korean drama or news.

Also, right now LL is displaying the next peice of art I am going to buy, please enjoy it, but don't buy \"my\" piece...pretty please.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pQ3kRVmttsV1bHxuTf7TAg"}

We were there at lunch and  were seated in the bar area quickly which was fine with us as it was a booth.  The waiter was attentive and competent.  I think some may not be too interested in being attentive since we were there on a coupon but that was not the case here.  I had the machaca beef which was well seasoned and a huge portion that I was not able to finish (and I really skimped on the beans and rice because I could see how much beef there was!!).  The salsa and chips were very good that was a chunky type which is my favorite but they also brought a hotter version which was a thinner concoction that we added to the large bowl of salsa.  My wife had a lunch special combination which she also liked.  The finale was when the waiter asked if we wanted anything else to finish off the $30 coupon and we were at $28 and I opted for the sopapilla;s which is a favorite and I expected 4 or 5 with some honey but it was a huge bowl with 20+ in it!!!  We took almost all of them home and ate them for the next couple of days.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was just that I like to see things like barbacoa, adobada, etc on the menu also.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZPz_yTApvQcNyINEFsCpOw"}

I still gave this place another chance, I have been there several times for lunch ordering the chicken katsu which is very moist and tender and always had a nice large portion for lunch.  I also ordered the half sized Udon noodles for $3.50.  Their udon broth is amazing.  This last time I went the service was horrible.  The chicken katsu was very small.  I asked for them to add tuna to my shrimp tempura roll and she said they couldn't do that... really?  The rolls are all very basic and boring.  The rice was very loose and the sushi roll too warm.  I couldn't even finish it and  it was just gross to put it simply. \n\nAnother con was that the waitresses can hardly speak english which makes ordering very difficult and extremely confusing.  This last waitress was very rude also.  I still left her a decent tip but she wasn't very accomadating and it was probably because she was the only waitress during the lunch hour.  The prices also seemed to have gone up dramatically for the sushi.

I have also heard good things about the Central Library. So when my friend and I decided to go visit Phoenix, we decided to stop off and see it. I must add though that the main reason we went was because the Travel Channel did a list of the world's weirdest bathrooms, and the bathrooms at the library came in second on the list. I know what you're saying too yourselves. That could be the lamest reason to visit someplace! Now that I think about it, you are probably right.\n\nThe 1 star is for the bathrooms. The actual library gets 3 stars, because although the building is stunning, I found the inside to be disorganized and a bit dirty. Back to the bathrooms though. We went into the bathrooms and there was nothing weird about it. So we decided to ask the librarian what made it weird and he did not know what we were talking about. He then told us that if you look into a little hole in the wall dividing the entryways into the men's and women's bathrooms, you can see light from the fiber optics installed in the library. He then said it's probably cool for only about a second and that it definitely was not weird. \nAnd guess what? He was absolutely spot on.\n\nNow I don't know who to blame. Should I blame the library for installing something so dumb? Should I blame the travel channel for putting this on the world's weirdest bathrooms, or frankly creating a list of the world's weirdest bathrooms? Or should I blame myself for going to a library to see this in the first place? Ah heck, I'll blame all three.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K04Sot5bwUk-BkOotkurmA"}

The glasses are smaller than those at AZ88, but just as filled to the brim and at less than half the price.\n\nThe food was OK.  I ordered the chopped salad, but was surprised to discover that it wasn't really \"chopped.\" Large chunks of red-leaf lettuce accompanied by cherry tomatoes, chopped onions, and a few other ingredients.  It could have been larger and more complex.\n\nThe prices are fantastic. Brad ordered the roast beef sandwich for around $9, which came on fresh focaccia bread and was stacked with bacon and a fried egg.  He said that it was OK, but could have benefited by some more flavor -- perhaps a nice sauce.  My chopped salad was around $8, so also a healthy bargain.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n\nThe service.  Our server admitted to forgetting to place our appetizer order (the bruschetta), so our entrees arrived first.  When she realized her mistake, she apologized and said that the bruschetta will \"be right out.\" However, she still charged us for it.  Not good.\n\nThe atmosphere.  Sterile and cold, with a monochromatic color scheme and too many clean lines.  It reminded me of a hotel bar in Manhattan, with minimalist intentions taken to the extreme.  There was nothing warm or inviting about Hanny's, and it's not the type of place I would have stopped in had I been simply walking through the neighborhood.  \n\nAll in all a nice option for a pre-game drink or snack, but not the type of place I'd make my destination on a Saturday night.

One Friday for lunch we sat at a table as it was someone's birthday. Long story short, the waitress -forgot- about our food for over 45 minutes (we were on a work break, keep in mind). The manager SAW THIS HAPPENING and did nothing because, in her words, \"we looked like we were having fun so she didn't want to interrupt\". Thanks Cricket (honest to God that's her name).  She then gave us giftcards (3 of them despite having a party of 10) and trotted away merrily.\n\nOn top of our food being atrociously late, myself and another were charged $7 over and when bringing it up to the waitress, she cheerfully said, \"it's okay you're still getting the same food!\" What the eff? \n\nSo with our food cold (and 3 of the orders wrong) we went back to the office and I complained on Twitter. Deborah from marketing responded to me with her email and myself and 2 coworkers sent very polite, but detailed emails expressing our displeasure. In response, Deborah found it appropriate to blame it on short staff and said she'd take us out to lunch there.\n\nIt's tacky, rude, and awful customer service to send the same generic, premade email to all of us.

If you're at Scottsdale mall and want to eat, walk the 10 feet over to the Yard House. Their food, drinks, waitstaff, and customer service are infinitely better.

I told my hubby we would try soon to go there and it happened to be today. OMG I can't believe I did not try this place sooner! Food was absolutely fabulous! It is even close to us YEAH!We loved the decor and the staff were very nice and accomodating. We had the spicy shrimp and eggplant app to start. Heaven on a plate! In fact, our server told us in the future we could ask to have this served with pasta and asparagus as a main dish in the future. (I guess this is popular among staff) The sauce is wonderful. I so wish I could get the recipe. Eggplant was cooked crispy to pefection.Topped with a single perfectly cooked shrimp. The sauce is so Yummy! Creamy, hint of wine.Has a bit of spice to it. Loved the bit of heat that lingers in the back or your throat.We lapped up every last drop of the sauce with extra bread she brought us. Today we brought our two kids. I had a hard time deciding what to order so it was good we were all together to sample each others dishes. I had the mediterranean pasta.Wonderful. Plenty of garlic. Feta cheese, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes spinach, pinenuts and plenty of basil. Nice and light. Daughter had the pasta with vodka sauce,Her pasta was perfect. Shaped like a little sache. Perfect texture with the wonderful Vodka sauce. Son had braised beef fettucini.The beef portions were like butter. If I had no teeth I still would have been okay. Lastly hubby had the mushroom ravioli. Creamy and rich, but not overly rich. Nice sprinkling of panko on top. I loved that the ravioli was not overloaded with cheese. I like tasting the mushroom.All were excellent. It would be really hard to decide which I liked best. Every dish was diffferent and full of favor.Prob would be difficult going there in the future without the 4 of us  if I had to decide on one dish. I am  almost embarrased to say we all cleaned our plates. However,don't be scared for my waist line, this was our only meal for the day. We ate our days worth :) Dont worry kids did eat light dinner) We decided we could not leave without trying dessert. We ordered the creme brulee trio and a single serv of cheesecake. The small servings are perfect. Creme brulee was light and lovely. Dinner with tip for 4 was$104.Not something we could do every week however when I go out I want it to be worth my money.Would definitely be a great place to take a date or to impress family or business clients.

I have also recently become a fan of the Fillet, as it is better than most steaks I have eaten that were three times the price at other places.\n\nThe Coconut sticky rice could be a meal all by itself, it is that good - and I am not a rice fan. Even the garnish/filler food is loaded with flavor.\n\nThe Mango Cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake desert of any place I have eaten, it is amazing.\n\nI think this is one of the best places to eat in Phoenix, and it is worth the wait, the drive, and the money.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

The head hostess was rude and didn't seat my party until an hour after my reservation time, which then cut into my karaoke room reservation time. They charged me for the full 2 hours even though we were barely in there for 45 mins, which was their fault. Furthermore, I booked a small private karaoke room, which under normal circumstances (meaning, a REAL karaoke sized room) would have accommodated my guests. The person I made the reservation with failed to mention that a small room will only fit 6 people MAX. It's more of a closet than a room. Most of my guests had to stand in the hallway because there wasn't enough room for them to sit down. It was horribly embarrassing. The seats were ripped up and the karaoke machine was totally outdated. They had a huge book of songs that was also totally outdated. They are also supposed to include a small sushi platter with the room which they didn't, I had to actually go find a server and ask for my sushi platter to go. Then the sushi was not rolled correctly and fell apart when I picked it up.\n\nI am VERY angry about my experience here. I feel ripped off and they ruined my birthday. I would have had a better experience making my own sushi and doing karaoke on the Wii or going to a karaoke bar in Phoenix where me and my guests could actually have room to breathe.

I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a \"better\" idea and suggested Athenian Express.\n\nAs we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.

Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.\n\nWe sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122\n\nNext, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658\n\nAs you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of \"gyro meat\" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.\n\nI move on to my side of potato salad.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283\n\nNormally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.\n\nAnyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209947387\n\nI'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.

While we waited, we purchased two Halloween cupcakes for the twins (they were not really great, no one ate them).  On the other side, breakfast was delicious. I started with the morning glory cocktail, bubbly, pineapple juice and cointreau.  It is a generous size, so I had to switch to a mimosa for my second one (good thing I was not driving).  I had the Menage with monkey cakes, wow the best pancake I have ever had.  The banana and coconut combination was so delicious,  I requested it without almonds (I don't have any allergies, I just didn't feel like having almonds).

That is how I would describe World of Beer.\n\nJust like WOB, I'm new to Tempe, so I wanted to see what all the hype was about. From its name I would defer that this world of beer was a casual establishment that put great pride in the variety of fancy, imported, non-U.S. made drafts. Kind of like a swanky wine bar but for beer. I was NOT expecting it to be so welcoming to the Friday/saturday crowd that Mill attracts. I thought it was going to take a more settled down vibe and boost in its sosphictacted-ness whilst the young-ins sip cheap vodka and Bud Lights at the clubs.\n\nBut no! This place was poppin' on a Friday night on Mill. I went for a a little pre-club drink and it was packed wall to wall. The bouncers almost didn't let me in because my I.D. is from MO which was an odd, but minor issue. The bigger issue was being able to hear yourself over the crowd. If you couldn't listen to the person next to you talk, no worries you were being otherwise entertained by the delightfully fun live band playing above the bar. The atmosphere was so chill and hip and welcoming to the average 20-something, much different from the stuffy, stuck-up vibe I was expecting. \n\nGotta pay major props to WOB for hosting such an awesome crowd while serving such an insane variety of beverage choices. I think it's pretty cool that a college bar enviroment now has somewhere where you can get a well-made, imported beer and not drink $4 well drunks made with $2 vodka. It's nice to be able to act and dress in the same attire as Que or Robby Fox's but enjoy a more mature drink and way cooler atmosphere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NIuaxYvM_-dzmgGXwPJ1Gw"}

Everyone was at barbecues or pools. However, the late dinner hour will be busy.

Nothing worse than a price increase and a quality decrease at the same time! \n\nI got my fiance hooked. I loved Fresh and Easy. I started shopping at one by my high-rise in Central Phoenix and then relocated to Greenway and the 51. We love high quality products and found some great ones at Fresh and Easy. \nThis morning I gagged drinking my coffee. We have been buying their half and half for about 8 months. We were buying 5 quarts a week. It tasted like I used whole milk instead of my creamy wonderful coffee. I looked at the label and sure enough. The label now says milk with cream. My guess by the taste is they waived the cream over the top and added a tablespoon.\n\nLast week they reduced the size of our favorite coconut cookies. We were buying 2-3  a week to a package that is 75% the size of the original one. Last month they changed their sour cream and put the words \"all natural ingredients\" boldly on the cover  and it couldn't be farther from the truth. It barely has any cream in it. They were charging $1.15 for the longest time. Then jumped up to $1.35 and then down graded from Cream and culture to a chemical blend. \n\nWe loved their tortilla chips until they another could be oil Canola oil which in research was the cause of mad cow disease and is a bug killer and totally detrimental to your health.  \n\nCheck this out.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISEhttp://www.living-foods.com/board/read.php?f=1&i=21641&t=21641\nIn looking at the ingredients through out Fresh and Easy they are downgrading rapidly to low quality no reason to shop there but to say hi to the great staff kind of place.\n\nOne door is closing for us and Costco is regaining our business back by offering high quality organic foods and to die for half and half for only pennies more than were were paying Fresh and Easy. \n\nWe are very bummed out for the layout, staff and selection verbiage at least is aligns with our family mission statement. \n\nSo I write today with hopes they put the skids on their down grading quality. I want the world to know their products are tasting weird. Even their whole milk is tasting compromised. It doesn't have a fresh taste.  Sadly many of Fresh and Easy's products that once were great are getting gross.\n\nOur family would really pay the price increase and have the same great quality and quantity.

After parousing their website, it turns out they were doing a special Easter Sunday Brunch.  We decided to book and check the place out. \n\nMy friend Stan Reinhold, a world renowned chef here in AZ, let me know this was a great place to go so I was happy to have the reservations as soon as we made them for such a popular holiday.\n\nOur reservations were for 12 noon, just 30 minutes after they started service for brunch. It ran through 3pm and there was not a free table to be had.  As soon as one was vacated, it was dressed and refilled before you knew it.  Its very dark and intimate, probably a great place for an anniversary or private moment with friends or loved ones. \n\nAll dressed in black, as were his counterparts, was Kevin, our waiter.  A pony-tailed boy off about 25 who appeared eager to take care of us. We started with a glass of the house Chardonnay and a Mimosa, which was one of their brunch special cocktail. \n\nThe full Sunday Dinner Menu was also available for those not looking for the brunch fare but we came for that so giving the regular menu its due, we opted to do brunch as planned.\n\nThis was NOT a buffet as are most high end establishments and their brunch offerings.  It was a set menu, with several choices.  We both had the same palate so our selections were identical.  Starting course was a fresh berry plate with a Sour Cream-Vanilla-Honey sauce that was very nice.  Beautiful fresh fruits and plenty of them.  \n\nRound two was a Crab Frittata made with Swiss Cheese, Mushrooms and Asparagus.  It was also served with a crispy Hash Brown, 2 sausage links and a Roasted Tomato half.  Interesting presentation, a good portion and quite tasty.  \n\nDessert offerings were three....New York Cheese Cake, Creme Brulee' and something else that was unmemorable.  We opted for the Cheese Cake and its additional side of sweetened cream along with a piping hot coffee. \n\nAll in all, we were there for the better part of an hour and a half.  The service was paced so that nothing came out until it was supposed to, which was nice.  There was a moment or two where it seemed to have gotten so busy we were left unattended to and our waters were in need of refilling for a bit too long.  (Kevin, you were nice, but your stock is plummeting)  Also, the tag-line Kevin used repeatedly when checking on us was getting old....\"How's that working for you?\"  Time to come up with something new.  I hate to think my dinner is \"working\" in any capacity.  \n\nSo, the bottom line is this.  Go on payday as there is nothing inexpensive about this place.  Morton's or Ruth's Chris it's not but certainly trying to get there. Plan on spending some time and don't think you will just zip in a zip out, its not that kind of place.  The food was delicious and you should expect nothing less. Would I go again?  Absolutely!  Would I recommend it to a friend?

It was a beautiful night out, and these window panes were open allowing us to feel like we were eating on a beautiful patio. \n\nThe service was excellent! The entire wait staff was very attentive, and were always ready to come over and fill our water or to make our dining experience even more enjoyable.\n\nThe atmosphere was also excellent. Ocean Club is less stuffy than Mortons but more lively than The Palm. The restaurant has a nice vibe to it which is complimented by life music.\n\nTo start I ordered the oysters on the half shell. This is presented with 6 fresh oysters on a mountain of crushed ice. These are served with fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce. These were very fresh, I just wish they gave you more! \n\nFor dinner I ordered the 22 oz bone-in ribeye (medium). This was perfectly cooked and delicious. I like to think of myself as a mini steak connoisseur (one likes to dream :) ) and this steak was certainly one of the best I had. Other people in our party ordered the filet, which I also tried and thought was great too.\n\nThe sides are easily shared.

I was beyond stuffed.\n\nOut of no where appeared 4 butter cakes with congratulations written on them in chocolate, and a candle for our birthday boy. As I put my spoon in to some vanilla ice cream and some cake and brought it to my mouth, my stomach seemed to get compacted and some space appeared. Before I knew it, 1/4 the cake was gone and I was satisfied. \n\nIn summary, Ocean Club has a great atmosphere, amazing food, and outstanding service.

I check my phone for the date and see that it is too early for Halloween.  Interesting.  Someone tried to pass this place off as a restaurant.  Wow, you got me going, good job.  Scared the shit out of me!\n\nLet us hit the brakes and back up a bit.  The parking lot here has had zero maintenance performed on it.  I think this building used to be an old Carl's Jr. or Jack in the crack that was poorly renovated and has a really piss poor paint job on the exterior.  Potholes in the parking lot made me think my truck had a flex capacitor in it and brought me back in to time to when I was in Philadelphia, dealing with the world's shittiest roads.  Nope, still in Arizona.  I assume there is a lobbyist in the vehicle alignment business working hand and hand with this establishment.\n\nIf you can get through this minefield of the parking lot, might as well go for broke and come into the restaurant.  There is an entertainment factor due to the signs all over the place yelling at you to not fill up your cup with soda if you have not paid for it.  Classy.\n\nI don't expect fillet mignon from Filiberto's but I also don't expect to have the cook stare at me the entire time I am waiting for my food.  That guy looks really pissed off.\n\nBeen here several times and wanted to enjoy the chip and salsa bar with almost zero chances to seize the opportunity.  The chips that are left are broken if there is any in there at all.  Ask them to put more in, the cook will just stare at you.  No chip refill.  There is a plastic fork laying in one of the salsa containers.\n\nThe air conditioning control unit is hanging about a food off of the ceiling only suspended by the failing duct tape trying so hard to defy gravity, like Sylvester Stallone trying to save the girl in the Movie \"Cliffhanger.\"  The walls here looked like there was wallpaper ripped off and never replaced.  A few of the seats have no padding on them,  but plenty of graffitti to read to help pass the time.  My particular booth on one visit read \"Fukkin Crakar\" written on it.  Maybe I should bring my Mom here for lunch.  I can teach her all there is to know about racial slang.\n\nThe bathroom is constantly trashed with no soap and am amazing amount of piss all over the floor.  No worries, there is yet more gang graffitti written in languages I can't read all over the stalls which I assume is not a positive message (like \"have a great day, champ!\")  There is no sign to indicate the men's room from the women's room either, the first time I was in there the men's room sign was sitting in the urinal.  Think they replaced it? \n\nBagging on Filiberto's is easy and I know that, but this particular location seems to really go out of their way to have a beat to shit restaurant.  It is more depressing than the condition of a landscaping pick up truck I once owned.  \n\nIf it wasn't for the Tuesday 99 cent menu... well...I really don't know how to finish this sentence.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mQ6_slsCd8-c8WFNtESnqw"}

Hang bags of water above doorways - flies won't go under anywhere they can sense water above them. Or let them crawl all over the food, as Postino seems to prefer.\n\nThe food was okay. It was very affordable though. The waitstaff is also very nice and polite, and despite the busyness of the morning, prompt.\n\nI'm not sure why they chose to have way more outdoor seating than indoor seating in a city that's unbearably hot for a good part of the year. Seems like a waste of space to me.\n\nOverall I'd like to visit for dinner or lunch. The food is affordable and well-made, but their handling of crowds can definitely be improved.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ss5gVggeSmAgMUeL65UvYw"}

Oscar (the owner) came over to the table and explained the best ways to eat it, and it was absolutely delicious! The pinto beans were whole and once again were absolutely cooked to perfection. He brought out 3 different salsas for us as well. One was the house salsa, which was the perfect blend of spice and sweet. The other was a much hotter salsa that definitely creeps up on you! It takes about 4 seconds before it tears you up! The third was a tomatillo salsa that was green. I'm not sure how to explain it but it was very good. For dessert I had the fried ice cream and it was awesome! The service was spectacular, as we were promptly seated and the food came very quickly!

I never get my nails done because I can rarely afford it, so this was supposed to be a nice treat. \n\nI walked in and was greeted and I was told they could take me immediately. So I quickly chose my polish colors (I was in a bit of a hurry) and waited for them to seat me. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take me to a station. I told my nail technician that I only had about a half hour for the manicure, and she said that would be no problem.\n\n An hour later they told me that my nails were dry and I was ready to go. Since it took twice as long as they originally said, I had to rush home and change for an event. After changing, I got in my car and glanced down at my nails, only to see that each one was smudged, some nails had the polished completely wiped off. \n\nFrustrated, the next day I went in to have the polish re-done. One of the women who works there, an older lady, glanced at my nails and said that she didn't see anything wrong with them. Then when I pointed out all of the smudges, I was told that they were \"too busy\" and to come back in an hour. Well, they closed in less than an hour. I went to run one errand and came back about a half an hour and the same woman (the older lady) was rude again to me. I asked to speak with the owner, who I stepped outside with and explained my situation. \nShe apologetically took me back in the store and set me up with my nail technician from the day before. This time she did a shellack manicure since it dries faster. When it came time for the top coat, the owner came over to do it her self. She snidely remarked that I was too impatient the day before and left before it was dry, which is not true. The fact that she had the nerve to say anything to me after the way I was treated the first two times was shocking. After my shellack dried, I left. \n\nThe shellack manicure lasted 3 days, even with good upkeep (I put a clear coat on it and I am never very hard on my nails). \n\nMoral of the story, this is a horrible place to have your nails done. Skip this place and go somewhere with better service!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ulwQfFPpJhUSjyWCTv4pdg"}

Tucked away in a strip mall, next to a Subway, there sits a wonderful French p\u00e2tisserie. And recently, they've started serving dinner.\n\nIt may seem a rather absurd notion that you could find amazing French cooking in a strip mall next to a Subway, but Duc Liao has managed to deliver in spades. The fashion photographer met his fashion-model wife in Paris and they jetted out to be closer to her mother, chasing a dream to start their own bistro.\n\nCharming story aside, the food is absolutely amazing. I started with a wonderful buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad served with mixed greens and a wonderful balsamic vinaigrette served on the side. The cheese was fresh and delicious and the presentation was spot-on. \n\nI moved on to the brilliant stuffed chicken breast, with a wonderful mushroom and rosemary stuffing, with tarragon and other wonders, served in a delicious sauce with rice pilaf. Absolutely incredible.\n\nMy partners in crime had the french onion soup and the foie gras salad. The french onion was a monument to great soup, while the foie gras was simply an insane amount of foie gras served for $14. My $12 chicken and the girlfriend's $5.50 house red really kept things reasonable as well.\n\nAs we were the last diners in there on a Thursday night, Duc came out from the kitchen and introduced himself, asking how we were enjoying ourselves. We discussed the lamb that girlfriend was eating and he lit up when she mentioned that medium rare is the best way to go. He began discussing his specialty lamb dish, but said that it typically requires 2-3 people at least to enjoy. He then invited us to call him and plan an evening around it, saying he'd run out and grab the special ingredients necessary and set to the four hour cooking process early in the day for us if we gave him due warning.\n\nOur other companion struck up a conversation on his own attempts with pastry and Duc walked him through some of the challenges and tips and tricks of the trade. The entire experience was absolutely incredible, and I can't wait to celebrate there very soon with our own special herb lamb offering, cooked up just for us by Duc, who absolutely insisted two or three times that we just give him a call and ask. \n\nOur server Howard was also friendly and fast and helpful and knowledgeable; all good things for a waiter. The experience as a whole was already spot-on, but interacting with the co-owner/chef was a treat and a privilege and I can't wait to bring my other foodie friends back for more.\n\n(Oh, and the dome chocolate hazelnut craziness that I had was incredible as well.)\n\nAbsolutely wonderful, and worth it in every way. Dress casual or dress up a bit, but don't expect any pretentiousness here. It's just amazing, simple, delicious food served by great people who clearly love their craft.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tZXPhvufHhfejGrRp554Lg"}

Bath rooms probably need a good in the cracks cleaning--- but overall it was clean.  (The kindof clean you want a restaurant bathroom to be in... get my drift?)\n\nBest crab puffs in the area! Yum, you get 8 cream cheese filled pffs for 4.95.  The egg drop soup ($4.00 for a large) was flavorful and really thick--- a little too thick for my preference and full of celery.  My husband raved about it, thought it was the best ever.  We also ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup ($7.25 for a large), would've been knocked out of the park with flavor, ingrediants, however, the cook added too much salt.  Kids ordered a large egg fried rice sans the peas/carrots.  It had a great buttery/bacony flavor to it.  Wow--- so good.  Our entree was the Honey Walnut Shrimp for $11.95.  Shrimp tasted fresh, no funky flavored shrimp.  The sauce was light and when I say \"light\"  it was tossed perfectly.  Shrimp to sauce ratio was spot on.  The shrimp was lightly battered, no tempura shrimp here.  The walnuts came a little light, could've used a little more but it was about 15 large shrimps on the platter.  They priced it right for what you got.  It's your standard American chinese food.   Will definitely be back.\n\nIt was good..... if my soup wasn't so salty I probably would've given it 4 stars.  I\"m thinking this was even 3.5 star establishment.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lAGDe38li38fyf971CslFg"}

Sold!!! \n\nFunny, that coming from a woman who drinks wine alot and is not a true beer lover, but I do love me some blue moon. When I found how cheap it was on happy hour as well as looking over the menu I was sold. Well I must credit the boyfriend as he was the one that said, I want to go there. So off we went. \n\nIt is a cute little place and I must say I was a little concerned when I pulled up because there were no cars in the parking lot. Hmmm not a good sign I thought. When we walked in, there were a few tables occupied and I was like eh, who cares, we came for the food. Our fabulous and friendly waitress (who's name I cannot remember) :( came over to greet us and take our order. Again I was bouncing off the walls because of the blue moon happy hour special. I mean anywhere else and it is $5 a glass unless you find a rare place that also has it on happy hour. They came served in small mason jar and the BF was like hmmm what the? I can't hold this, its too dainty for me. I swear lol. \n\nSo on to the food. I ordered the stuffed burger that was essentially two big ass patties stuffed with peppers, mushrooms and bacon. Just greedy!!! BF order the bbq platter that came with brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs and beef ribs. Good lord that was alot of food. I am still amazed that I ate my burger as you really can't take it home to eat it as leftovers and there was no way I was leaving any. BF on the other hand ate all the pulled pork and brisket but couldn't eat any more as the portion was huge so needless to say, I have ribs to eat for dinner later. Score for me. \n\nOh and kicker to this, I happened to check in on YELP and ding, ding, ding, we ended up getting a free dessert! I truly had no room for it and yes I should have saved it but alas we got the strawberry shortcake to top off our gluttony for the night and it was delicious as well. \n\nSo if you happen to be in North Phx, check out this place. It is cute and small, the waitresses are great, the portions are big. Win-win in my book.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UUssRgBCO_riWg3chbv9Zg"}

So, I USED to be a regular when I lived around the corner. There is ALWAYS great competition at the pool tables. Most of the patrons are nice and chatty. Drinks have always been crazy cheap and they have 2 for 1's. \n\nOkay, I have been back twice recently. Here we go:\nTrip A: I arrived after 9pm ready for some drinkin and some shootin' (pool that is.) The first thing that I noticed was that the bouncer guy was behind the bar making drinks. (This same guy tried to kick me out before because I stopped drinking after 3 beers and wouldn't order another. The owner knew me THEN as a regular and told me that I could stay.) Anywho.... I put that as far back in my mind as it could fit and ordered a drink. He made it pretty strong, pretty fast, AND I received a shot glass to which meant that I had another free drink coming... for 5 bucks??? ALL IS FORGIVEN.\n\nI went over and marked my name on the chalkboard for the pool table and waited. Wasn't too bad of a wait, but bring your on cue... these ones need a bit of tlc. \n\nI went up to the karaoke dj (who was also playing dance music) and requested a song. The first 2 times he didn't even acknowledge my presence and when he finally did, he pointed at his tip jar before he'd even HEAR my request. Last I checked, people EARN tips... shot pool and got tipsy for the rest of the night.\n\nTrip B: Arrived with a good friend. She was loving the atmosphere at first. We ordered drinks (same great drink specials... never fails.) Same great competition at the pool tables. But..... unfortunately the SAME dj. Ugh. We went over to request karaoke songs. Found some good ones, she TIPPED him and we asked how long. \"Bout 15 minutes\" was the reply. An hour and a HALF later, she goes to check on the songs. He doesn't have them.... he doesn't have them? No. Huh???\n\nI go over and ask what happened. This time I ACTUALLY PAID ATTENTION and this man was UBER DRUNK. Looking at the mixed up slips of paper in front of him like they were some kind of undecipherable code... I asked AGAIN after sifting through the ALREADY played songs and finding our slips, \"how long?\" He looks at me (I'm sure he saw 3 of us) and says \"no more. Karaoke's over.\" Mmmmmmkay.\n\nI went back to shoot my last game before we went to another place with a SOBER dj, and can you guess what happened as I was racking??? Yup karaoke all over the speakers. I used to love you, Snap. The security guy changed his tone and has been awesome since that incident.... please find another dj.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y-jTQqdSIZO6tzKYdwpcVA"}

It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

I booked a table for two through OpenTable.com, but when I checked the restaurant website, it said they were closed on Sundays. So did the voice recording I got. Hmm. Sooooooo, I quickly cancelled the reservation in favor of BLT Steak. \n\nWe decided to check out Bourbon Steak another night, since every night seems to get you 1,000 points on OpenTable. Unfortunately we weren't super hungry and we'd already had steak, so it took us a long time to decide what to order.\n\nThis was complicated, though pleasantly so, by the arrival of the famous Michael Mina trio of duck fat fries, compliments of the restaurant. These little sticks of crispness were some of the best fries I've ever had. They were great on their own, but also came with a trio of sauces, including truffle aioli and a spicy ketchup. I hate cold fries when they get all soggy, but somehow these fries retained their uber-crispness even after they'd been at the table for a while.\n\nI had originally planned to try one of their burgers because I also wanted the fries, then I considered the foie gras sliders as my entree. Finally, we decided to share a rib-eye. Honestly, the menu seemed limited compared to BLT Steak's, which was probably a good thing.\n\nA small loaf of truffle oil-brushed focaccia appeared on our table shortly after we placed our order, but I had to request that the fries be left behind as the server whisked them away. The steak was quite good, and cooked medium-rare, as requested. It was served to us sliced, on the bone, since we were sharing. However, it was sliced purely by grain, not by cut, so one of us had more of the tender strip than the other. The side of squash that we'd ordered was nicely seasoned and a very large portion. All in all, I felt the food was good but not fantastic.\n\nEven though we were comfortably full and originally planned to decline dessert, we were swayed by the beignets with a choice of three different accompanying puddings. My boyfriend couldn't resist the butterscotch pudding with a topping of Macallan 18-year-old Scotch. These little beignets were good, but the pudding was amazingly creamy, and topped with a sigh-inducing Scotch caramel sauce.\n\nWe have a Michael Mina restaurant in San Jose, and I would definitely try it after eating at Bourbon Steak. The promise of duck fat fries and Scotch pudding are definite draws, but so are the specials offered on certain nights at Bourbon Steak. If the hamburger nights and 50% off wine nights are available at Arcadia, you'll find me there soon with a bigger appetite, perhaps trying the lobster pot pie or a spiked shake.\n\n3.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "8m08a9xJKmANwmeuR-0bPA"}

Don't get me wrong I appreciate a new twist on an old classic but this was sheer laziness. First off it's a square not round pizza this in my mind was a plus due to the thickness and crispiness. However that was the only plus to the whole pizza. \n\nFor those of you that went to public elementary school do you remember pizza day? Its was a square greasy piece of pizza with cubed pepperoni. Well the Hawaiian pizza at Crust isn't far off.\n\nThe pizza came out with 8 large slices and a medium thick crust. The cheese and meat looked like deli slices you would pick up at safeway laid on top not even covering the pizza. The final touch was canned cubed pineapple on top of the deli meat and cheese.\n\nIf you are looking for a $25 pizza your toddler can make but want to call it a Scottsdale fusion then I suggest you run to Crust.

I ordered the tickets, which were front row btw, at a decent price for seats reserved...not bad for $38 per ticket i thought. I waited a week and a half for my tickets to make their journey through the mail, but still nothing, even on the day of the concert, nada! I called and was told they would be there at will call for me, so i show up after struggling to find a sitter for my daughter and the long drive from Queen Creek, only to just be escorted to our seats, no ticket stub for a keepsake or anything(AWESOME #1....not). \nWe get to our table and not only are the seats i reserved not empty, but apparently they thought i'd be cool with letting someone else sit in one of our reserved seats and myself or my wife just slide over one. Well, that would have been cool if i wanted my head right next to a PA system, and to krank my neck up like i was talking to Shaq for 3 hours, but not only do i like my hearing, but i also have a bulging disc in my neck....(AWESOME #2!). \nWhen we were seated, it took roughly 15 minutes before a server came to speak with us even to ask us if we wanted a drink or menus...sure why not....my wife and i decide that we will each get one item, i was gonna get a beverage and she was getting a desert, since we had just eaten dinner while on the way to the show. About 10 minutes later, a different server approached us, we gave our order...only to be told that we must both order 2 items minimum, otherwise it will be an additional $10 per person(Awesome #3) I'm pretty sure i paid for my concert ticket, not a food plate...thanks though, not so much!\nWe finally just got fed up so that we told the server we were not going to order any item, only to be told, rudely i might add, that it states such on the ticket stub(which once again we hadn't received). Obviously not an issue i could help them with, especially seeing as how their was barely even walking room for anyone over 95 lbs. Crowded is a good thing for a concert, but do you really want the assortment of food smells and liquors mixed with the other customers bad breath as the scent of a date night. (That's #4!)\nAfter the show was over, right as we were in the process of getting up from our seats to make our way to the door, our original server approaches us, immediately apologizing for the other servers actions and tone. We stated it was fine but we will definitely never be going back. For being nice, so to speak...i'd rather stick to real venues...that actually are about service, not dollars...one thing i have learned in my life...treat people right, be treated right....No TIP FOR YOU!.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QQplckr0yVO-8DSPFpbGBQ"}

My family originally wanted IHOP, but I told them I wanted to try something new. They suggested that we go to Black Bear Diner, but they were closed. So I went on Yelp and suggested Scramble.

The pancakes were a bit rubbery, but the service, ambiance and other good food made up for the shortcoming.  I definitely recommend it.  Everyone else in our 10+ party enjoyed their food and said they'd probably come back.\n\nIt's in a kinda weird area for me, since growing up here that particular area was referred to as the \"ghetto\".

What I most liked about Quiessence was that it was country food the way I would want to live in the country.  Less biscuits and fried stuff, more fruit of the land.\n\n+1 Star - Atmosphere.  Its sexy sexy sexy here.  More or less.  The fire pit on the way up the walkway (a walk lined with flowering vines, lush plants and the like) was so inviting.  The dining space was a tad over-lit, and you know how we ladies like our flattering lighting.\n+ 1 Star - Organized staff.  They had my reservation all squared away and they had saved a nice table for us, even though we were 15 minutes late (being Spanish, that means on time to me). We were swiftly attended to, but never felt rushed.\n- 1 Star - Beers and wines by the glass.  Not quite as much selection as we would have liked, even though the list is not meager.  Quality was good.  I would like to see more than one sparkling by the glass and a few more up-market selections by the glass.  They have an excellent list by the bottle, though.\n+ 1 Star - Food sourcing.  Its one thing to serve good food, which I demand (!).  It's another to care about where that food came from.  I can't recall exactly what we had (I had found some wine I liked!), but some of the standouts were the vegetables that came from the property that were a part of each dish.  + 1 Star - Menu.  We did the tasting menu ($65 a head) which was an alternative to ordering ala carte.  I was thrilled with my salad.  It was probably the best I have had in... forever?  He loved his entree, lamb with vegetables.  He looked at his place setting after finishing and commented that he had not used his knife!  Lamb was like butter!\n- 1 Star - Dessert.  Talk about a let down.  He had a white tiramisu that was okay, but not great.  I had pears on a shortbread cookie.  Not good at all.  The cookie was inedible.  These guys need a pastry chef.\n+ 1 Star - Romance.  It was so romantic here that we were inspired to go make out in the bathroom for a while. Should have seen the looks on people's faces.  Geez.  Prudes.  But it is one of the most bodice-ripping inspiring places I have been in a short while.  \n- 1 Star - Pricing.  Overall, $65 per head is not outrageous, but seems high for what was received.  I was not blown away by my entree - a poached egg with veggies.  Really?  Not so much.\n\nI am torn whenever writing reviews if I should be rating them (via the yelp star system) against their potential or against the overall establishments in the world or if I should rate them against those in their home town.  I feel very conflicted about rating Quiessence only 4 stars, as I believe it is likely one of the best that Phoenix/Scottsdale has to offer.  However, I would like to see them improve their desserts and also pay a bit more attention to lavishing on the guests (for example, it was a cold night, but they could have up-sold he and I to a drink by the fire pit outside if they had offered blankets or the like) before I give them 5 stars.  \n\nThese guys need to be a little less precious in my view, keep their focus on the local sourcing, and get away from the overly fluffy presentation.  I liked this place very much and will try them again in the future, perhaps for their beautifully presented brunch, whiff of animal dung coddling my nostrils on a fair weather day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A"}

Since everything is new, *all* the machines actually - wait for it - FUNCTION. The prices are comparable other facilities, $1.25 for a small washing machine, $2.25 for the 2-loaders, $3.25 for the 3-loaders... and it goes up to 6-load capacity machines. Oh yeah, and free wi-fi! And free coffee! Very nice touches.\n\nThey also have laundry services here, where you drop it off and the staff does it for you.

Given the style inside the place, you would have assumed you would be eating some eccentric dish.  Not this place!  Just keeping things fairly low key and loose.  And that comes across as truly original in my book - something I've found a lot of Phoenix establishments lacking.  \n\nI can repeat the reviews with the darkly lit rooms.

I guess to each their own...\n\nAll in all, as a visitor to Phoenix several times, I came away a sense that this is one of those big city finds that I also thought was missing in Phoenix.

We were getting the oil changed on my husband's car (or something else equally mundane) and a salesman kept trying to get us to test drive a new car but we had no interest. He finally sweetened the deal with a Ruth's Chris gift card. Long story short, we drove the car, got the gift card, got our car back and went to dinner. \n\nWe got there and sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and scotch before we moved to our seats. I've got to say, this is the only location I've been so I can't speak for the ambiance of others, but this one is sorely lacking. The lighting is bright, it feels overly open and the air conditioner was blowing full force. \n\nWe started with the wedge with blue cheese. It was as expected. Iceberg with bacon and blue cheese. Hard to screw up. Tastes good. I don't remember was cut if steak we ordered but I was talked into getting the butter on my plate. Huge mistake. It just made it overly rich. I also can't say I'm a fan of the searing hot plate. It made my medium rare steak progressively more cooked. If it has to go in either direction, I prefer it to be rarer. My husband wanted the au gratin potatoes so we shared an order of those. Here's another one of my beef's. Sometimes restaurants equate richness (butter and cream) with flavor and goodness, which they are, but they stop there. They load up the potatoes au gratin with sticks of butter and pints and heavy whipping cream and think, \"Viola! I have created a masterpiece!\" but in reality they're just rich and really don't have much flavor. You can probably tell I didn't think much of them. \n\nFor desert we ended up with the chocolate sin cake and the creme brulee. Both were OK but so are the frozen deserts from Trader Joe's. I'd say they were on par with those. OK when I'm paying $4.99 for two and preparing them myself. Not so much when buying one in a restaurant. \n\nNothing was bad at Ruth's Chris, I was disappointed to find that nothing stood out as phenomenal. Next time I'll stay home and make some steaks myself, we'll eat them in our pajamas with a bottle of wine them watch some Mad Men.

We went there for lunch and it was rather empty and that is what it felt like. When you walk in, to the left there is a restaurant and to your right there is a bar. Both have completely different conflicting styles. The place should just decide what it is going to be, either a huge sushi dinning hall or a modern bar. There were large flat panel TVs all over the place, so maybe the owners are just in it to cash in on the sporting events. \n\nThe sushi was not impressive. It was not fresh but as another comment said, it was in fact chewy. The edamame was over cooked and had a weird smell to it as if the pot it was cooked in had not been washed. The California rolls tasted like they were made from fake crab. The miso soup had a weird flavor too. It is sad to see such corners cut which could have otherwise made this place better.\n\nWe were told by a fellow co-worker that it was cheap, however when we got there I found that not to be the case. The prices are a bit higher than RA Sushi. Check splitting is really easy, they do it for you automatically. Our waitress was lighting quick. \n\nWhen you open up a sushi restaurant on Mill Ave right next to RA Sushi expect to be compared to it. Hands down I would rather go to RA Sushi or Kabuki (near Tempe Marketplace) than to Kanpai Sushi & Bar. Given Mill Avenue's track record for shops/restaurants that go out of business, I don't give this place very long.\n\nNote: We did not drink alcohol.

My favorites are the brioche slices with jam and the honey bran muffins....and the mexican wedding cookies.....and the lemon bars. Service is always quite friendly and fast. They have just plain cool people working here. This place runs smoothly.\n\nSo then why just 3 stars A-oK? I'm totally on LUX's side! Good service, tasty coffee and nice bites....but here's why:\n\nThe computer people. There are faaaar too many computer folk at this place taking up waaayyy too much room. And they're not considerate enough to just go home after three hours. Now, before anybody has a coronary - just know that I'm aware that computers are a part of our everyday lives now (I guess) and people don't have to be confined at home to study blah blah blah but COME ON. This is a social atmosphere - designed to chat and laugh and make new friends and have coffee. If you're ordering one cup of tea and stretching it out over several hours while taking a seat that somebody with a pulse and some social skills could be occupying - that's just rude.\n\nThis place needs to 86 the free Wi-Fi and let people pay for limited times of web access. Period. LUX used to be more of a social atmosphere, but they've caved into the laptop \"nesters\" and set no guidelines whatsoever. So most days you walk in, and the only sound is the music, because nobody is talking. Instead there are over-serious, glossy-eyed lumps of what used to be humans doing their research papers for college or googling themselves or updating their facebook status every three minutes because they're bored and nobody wants to talk to them. And staring you down as you come in like you're invading THEIR space.\n\nNesters....go HOME. If you can't study without being in this environment from dusk til dawn, maybe you're not that interested in what your'e studying - which might mean your'e in the wrong major. Or your concentration just sucks ass. You can't have your brioche and eat it, too.\n\n   Your 1 Computer\n+ Your 8 Binders\n+ 3 Huge Biology Books\nx  How little you actually study\n----------------------------------------\n= You're annoying and you need a home office.\n\nother than that, I like going here, but get your frickin' powercord outta' my mocha!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw"}

Quality ingredients being made by hand in smaller batches of course! Today my family and I visited Stacey Barnes and Donna Gabilson the daughter-mother team of GoodyTwos Toffee Company. With their silhouettes gracefully placed on their smart, modern packaging, GoodyTwos mixes up traditionally-made, \"darn good\" toffee with a bright, creative presence. This creativity also drives them to reach out to their customers using nontraditional avenues of new and social media. We hadn't even visited their establishment yet and my wife, Michelle was already having a conversation with Stacey via Twitter last night.\n\nWhen you visit GoodyTwos, the toffee takes center stage. There are samples of EVERYTHING sitting out for you to try. You must start with their \"Traditional\" toffee, the foundation for all of their mouth-watering goodness. The toffee smells like Christmas. And when you bite into it, it's crunchy and buttery but won't break your teeth. It's a perfect balance of butter and chocolate and... well, whatever else they put into their toffee. If you're into that sweet and salty vibe, then look no further, the \"Sweet and Salty\" is the way to go! It's a beautiful marriage of dark chocolate and sea salt tossed with almonds - I think it may be my wife's favorite. They also have unique flavors like the \"Nutty-Twist\" which includes some reduced Cruz tequila, and \"Double Trouble\" which is pretty much peanut butter cups on steroids.\n\nSo it was 110 degrees when we visited their store in Scottsdale today. There is nothing that says Christmas or holiday treats in this heat. And yet, inside their store, eating toffee on such a hot, summery day was absolutely appropriate. (They even have ice cream \"toppers\" i.e. toffee chunks!) Stacey and Donna are two joyful and smart women who really care about their product. From the moment you walk in, you're welcome to experience the sights and tastes of some incredible toffee. By the way, they ship locally and internationally. So don't fret, the toffee won't melt. They've figured out all of that fancy shipping packaging so that you get your treats fresh and tasty. Thank you GoodyTwos for a great afternoon!\n\nMy daughter Cadie, thoroughly enjoyed a toffee treat. My wife and I heard \"More please!\" from her a lot all afternoon afterwards.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gAwoeSYoyVjp5rcwnaTz2w"}

However, my friend had a gift certificate for $50 and was looking forward to  having a nice Italian meal.  \n\nWe had a 6:30 reservation and was promptly greeted and seated.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and was patient in answering our questions about the various menu items.  \nFor starters we had the artichoke hearts stuffed with seafood drizzled with a Vodka sauce (mmm Yummy!) Just the right amount of garlic but not so much to overpower the delicate seafood mixture.\n\nWe decided to skip the salad and went straight for our entrees:  P had the seafood creps (again, in a Vodka sauce with pistachios.)  I opted for the halibut.  The halibut presentation looked like a Picasso artwork and the halibut steak was the lightest and flakiest I have ever had in my life. Sauteed in seasoned olive oil and italian bread crumbs with three circles on the side of the plate consisting of pureed green pepper drizzled with red pepper sauce. ( Isabella, owner and chef , cheerfully shared her recipe with me but I don't think it would ever come close to how she prepared this awesome fish) She told us that she purchases most of her produce from local growers as well as her meat.  She is a proponent of the \"Slow Food Movement\" and understands the importance of supporting local growers and businesses.\n\nFor dessert we shared  freshly made 3 cheese cake with mix of fresh berries - it was light and oh so delicious. The homemade Tirmasu -light with perfect layers of sponge cake soaked in coffee liqueur combined with sweet whipped cream, mascarpone cheese, coffee, cinnamon and cocoa powder was also divine\nThe wine list was small but original (not your typical run of the mill or popular California wines) and the cappuccino was excellent.\nService was not too slow nor rushed.  The menu also has a couple of gluten free dishes\nThe only slight negative was the bus person who seemed to have an ongoing tiff with our waiter.  This was more amusing than anything else. \n Most of the tables are rather close together which is probably not conducive to a confidential conversation. A couple of the tables at the entrance seemed a little more private.

The Tee Pee was one of my Step Dad & my Mom's favorites places to come and eat while they were visiting. For years they would go on tubing trips down the river, and their favorite place to go afterwards was the Tee Pee. It was a tradition. \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely casual. It is laid back which I love. The patio is pretty cool, with the tv's and the misters. The owner was extremely considerate and was very, very nice. He gave our huge party complimentary cheese crisps  for every table, as he had heard what had happened, which I will give an extra star, because service does matter. The servers, bartender's, and the owner are all super friendly and pleasant. \n\nThe only issue I had with the place was the food. It was terrible. The famous cheese crisps are just a simple flour tortilla with melted cheese. The chips were stale, the salsa average. The guacamole was pretty good however. My brother and I split the chicken chimichanga. It was massive. It was a little too greasy for my taste. I have had better mexican food at chipotle. I don't really get what all the other reviewers are raving about, how Tee Pee serves authentic Mexican food, in my opinion it's simpy Tex Mex. I am from MD and I think I have had more authentic Mexican food in my home town. I thought I would be in for a treat being in AZ. So I was extremely disappointed in the food. Not a huge fan of the margarita's either, the only good thing about them was the salt. \n\nNeedless to say I was glad to experience a place that they had loved and enjoyed together. However I think they forgot to mention that they were always hammered after those all day tubing trips so I am sure the food was amazing after several cold beers, and the Arizona sun.", "type": "review", "business_id": "soiGohHtWOltGeomkSxzEw"}

It tastes like the linguini was born in the sauce (LA Friends...Gardens of Taxco anyone?....) It's all you can eat too. And cheap. 6-7 bucks.\n\nI'd come back. I'd also come back after that.

I hate waiting for refills! \n\nThe problem with a menu in which everything sounds good, you can't decide on anything! And I couldn't decide! So with desperation in my eyes, I asked my server for a suggestion. He recommended the APRICOT BBQ CHICKEN SANDWICH w/ warm sliced chicken, shredded spinach, cilantro and red onion on warm ciabatta bread. OMG! This sandwich was so flippin' good! You know....it tasted like a bbq chicken pizza ....but as a sandwich. There! That's the best description.

Scramble is getting 4 stars instead of 3 because I truly appreciate the effort to offer vegan items and how they responded to vegan inquiries. Having said that, a few minor things continue to bother me:\n\n1. I feel like the tofu in the vegan burrito isn't really seasoned anymore. It was never heavily seasoned but I feel like it's gotten a bit more bland and sometimes appears like its just plain tofu heated up. \n\n2. I feel like the tortilla would be better if it was grilled a bit. It seems kind of chalky and cold when I am wanting it to be browned and slightly warm.\n\n3. The soy chorizo is a nice addition but it's kind of close in texture and consistency to the tofu so it all just blends together. Something like some veggie sausage or tempeh bacon in with the tofu or as an option would be a great. \n\nIt might seem like I am complaining but lets face it, you don't have many vegan options in Phoenix for breakfast. Ironically that might be why I am not impressed as much now as was forced to figure out how to make a mean vegan scramble and vegan breakfast sandwich at home for all these years, so maybe I have just had more practice and now I know what works and what doesn't.\n\nThe sweet potato hash is still fantastic and was a knock out addition to the menu (for vegans and omnis!)\n\nI still dig the decor, it's always clean, the service is good, the bathrooms are nice and the consistency issues seems to have gotten much better.

We are always on the look out for a good burger and were excited to read about The Grind in the paper. Knowing the chef has proven culinary skills of the highest caliber and their use of a very unique 1000 degree oven intrigued us. We rounded up a few friends and gave it a whirl last night. \nAt first glance, the place is comfy. The booths are excellent people-watching pedestals and the bar is long enough to house most of us for that pre-dinner cocktail. We enjoyed the throw back drink menu - Honey  had a Vesper and was pleased to rekindle his affection for the marriage of gin and vodka. A cute old man next to me was thrilled they had PBR on tap. \nWe began our meal with the \"roasted cheese\" appetizer, aka Camembert infused with rosemary. I loved the crostinis it was served with. The cheese was good and tastefully appointed with a strawberry relish. I relish new takes on old standbys, so thumbs up. \nOur burger dining procedure is that we each order one and then split them to allow for candid discussions and a larger experience of bun-and-meats. I ordered the Sweet and Spicy as many have recommended on Yelp, and Honey ordered the BLT. Friends ordered the chicken sandwich and another BLT. For the table we requested the Herbed Fries and Sweet Potato Fritters. \nService was consistent, well timed and pleasant. The burgers are presented in a rather intimidating fashion of being much too tall for anyone to get their mouth around. However, we quickly learned that our 5-year old's tactic of squishing sandwiches proved successful and instantly my too tiny cake hole was inspired. \nMy burger was flipping great. I loved LOVED the sweet and spicy. So many flavor experiences with every bite. Just enough heat to make it a child-unfriendly burger, but not enough to disrupt the experience. BLT burger was not as well received, but I do celebrate a good grilled onion and they did not disappoint. \nWhat was disappointing was the fries and fritters. I have come to expect gourmet fries with my gourmet burger. I don't think I'm wrong in this expectation, but The Grind let me down. Their herbed fries were something I could buy a bag of at Albertson's. Nothing notable. And the fact that there were fries left at the end of the meal with four diners sort of speaks volumes. The fritters too...just not great. Deep fried, rather flavorless, more savory that I would expect in anything sweet potato. Sigh. \nMoving on to dessert since we did not fill up on fried potatoes, we ordered the warm doughnuts with salted butterscotch. I love doughnuts and I love a good salty sweet concoction. It was really, really good. The doughnuts weren't overly sweet on their own, which seemed to lend itself well to the sweetness of the butterscotch. Being a Dessert Diva, I would say it was a nice way to end the meal. \nOverall, I think we will return. However, it may be more of a \"let's sit at the bar and have a beer and a burger\" type experience than a sit down dinner effort. Definitely worth a visit, not a letter home.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r-a-Cn9hxdEnYTtVTB5bMQ"}

I finally move and a great place opens up...WTH? I am very happy that Ahwatukee is finally getting a few places that are up to my urban girl standards (Hillside Spot and Pomegranate). I was waiting like a kid on Christmas day for this place to open. One Sunday while at the Farmers Market I passed by and it was jammed packed. Not what I was looking for on a quite Sunday morning. I stopped by again during the week and they were closed. Talk about disappointed. I did snag a menu and it looked rather promising.\n\nA few weeks go by and I stop in for lunch. The place is crowded but not crazy crowded. I go up to the counter and order and they give you a little number for your table or they call your name, I can't remember. I grabbed my drink at the self service area. I got a great ice tea. This is coming from a complete tea snob. I waited a few minutes and out came my tuna sandwich. To my surprise the bread was toasted. OK so I am about to go on a bit of a tangent here...TEXTURE, TEXTURE, TEXTURE. I hate tuna sandwiches on soft bread. It feels like a pile of mush in your mouth. Totally yucky in my book. But this sandwich was on toast...YEAH someone got the texture memo. However, the tuna was bland, with a bit more seasoning this could be an awesome sammie.\n\nMy next encounter was a few days ago. Just finished hiking South Mtn and decided to stop in with a friend. We were not starving but wanted a little something. I was told for dinner they have table service. OK I am standing at the register like it is lunch time. Maybe they should have a sign up for that. No biggie. The dinner menu was very small. I found myself looking at the lunch menu wishing some of the selections were available for dinner. We decide to split the Derby Salad and french fries. We wait what seems like forever and our fries come out by a runner. She says the salad would be out shortly. Well the salad took forever and a day. We were almost finished with the fries by the time the salad came out. \n\nThe kitchen is open so I could hear the cooks having some issues with my salad. It appeared that one of the ingredients was missing (bacon) but they located some and fried it up. It was a nice touch to the salad. But as long as I waited I could have done without it. The fries were fresh cut and just the right amount of seasoning. On my way out I spotted the biggest slice of red velvet cake in the cooler. OMG a little bit of the South started to come out. If you lived in the South you know what I mean. Red velvet cake is one of my favorites. I asked about the price and it was a very inexpensive $4.50. Wow what a steal. But today is not cheat day so I have to wait. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is cool.  However, a bit dark inside at night. This place has great potential. A definite need for this neighborhood. I think the menu might have to get tweaked and maybe the kitchen staff could be better prepared. As time goes on I am sure they will work out the kinks. All in all I don't think you would be disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nts2OALwvyvfNh9focRZ3w"}

But don't be too sad because once 9 30 rolls around they have great drink specials.  $3 long islands etc etc.  \n\nThey serve food all night too.  The Ghost Pepper wings were AWESOME. I love spicy hot food and the bartender kept warning us about these wings- even gave us plastic gloves to eat them with- warned us about going to the bathroom afterwards without a thorough hand washing.  They were sooo good! Yes, they were hot but they still had flavor, which is really hard to find in 'super hot foods'.  Granted I had my fair share of alcohol coursing though my veins.  So take what you may from the Ghost Pepper Wings review.  \n\nIts a big place with lots of different areas including a DJ/dance area. The DJ's are awesome - especially Julio-  Totally a hipster vibe there - along the lines of Timeout Lounge and Yucca.  Everyone there is super friendly in the best way... not like 'I am a predator that just wants to take you home with me so I will pretend to care what your name is' or 'I am a creepy man that will roofie your cosmo when you look away' ... but rad people that can hold conversations.

I only go to the Tempe location; I tried the Chandler one a couple times but it was not nearly as good or consistent as the Tempe one. This restaurant is awesome! Great for casual eats or formal meets like dates or group dinners. The food is very reasonably priced, huge portions, very fresh food, and very very delicious! Whenever my family comes to visit, we always plan at least one meal here. I have loved every dish here; no joke, it's all belly pleasing goodness. Here are some of my favorites (some have meat from before I was a vegetarian):\n\n*the medchilada: a giant burrito wrapped in lavosh, no longer on menu but they still make them upon request at this location* the hummus: I like half roasted red bell pepper and half cilantro jalapeno, this explodes with flavor and is a great starter for non-hummus consumers* tsatziki: they have the best tsatziki ever, omg, just the right amount of seasoning, I could drink this stuff* gambas con ajo: jumbo shrimp swimming in a delicious light red sauce, served with a pesto cheese covered pita* MTB: mozzarella, tomato, basil with evoo and balsamic, huge slices and very fresh* grilled vegetable salad: huge and covered in yummy veggies, thought it would be weird to have hot veggies on a bed of salad but oh-no-sir, this is sooo yummy!* California beach club: stuffed with turkey, cheese, and lots of veggies in a pita. I still get this minus the meat and always get tsatziki on the side. This is a nice cold, fresh option.* broiled chicken pita: huge chunks of tender chicken in a pita with all the right fixings...although their garlic sauce is super yummy, I trade it out for tsatziki.* spicy chicken wrap: oh man, this will clear up any congestion you may have, so yummy, and so spicy...if it's not hot enough for you, try it with extra saracha.* Pesto lavash turkey wrap: if you're not a fan of hot turkey, swap it out for their scrumptious chicken* black bean burger: mmmm mmmm mmmm...I like to get mine on their whole wheat bun, the roasted red peppers and other toppings make this* glazed chicken lavosh pizza: oh man this is what pizza should be about, savory and sweet, the caramelized onions are soooo good on this pizza!* chicken combo platter: a bit of everything, make your own pita sandwich, mix and match flavors* fruit & cheese fantasia: a great platter to share, tons and tons of fresh fruit and lots of varieties of cheese, served with a pita.*", "type": "review", "business_id": "eGevCRobYnA_HSj60sEWvQ"}

Once in the restaurant it has nice decor with heat lamps using flames all around the restaurant. We were seated facing the city with a mountain view. The walls in front of us were slid open so we were essentially outside. Amazing and romantic setting. \n\nFor appetizers, my wife had the fire roasted oysters.  Has to be some of the best oysters we've ever had!  Crusty on the top but juicy underneath.  I had the citrus cured pork belly with currants. Very nice and tasty although I would have preferred the outside of the pork be more crusty with the inside moist. It was still very good. \n\nFor entrees we had the scallops with lobster dumplings and the Kubota pork chop with 5 spice and hoison sauce.  Both dishes were amazing although the pork chop was the best. We were a little disappointed that the scallop entree came with TWO scallops. For that price we'd expected more but they were tasty. We also had the glazed carrots which were spectacular.  A good selection of wine rounded out the dinner. \n\nFor dessert we had the PB bomb. Incredible. And it was sized perfect to share after the meal. \n\nIf you haven't been there it's worth the visit for a romantic dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2OY8xs4aqOt8eTnYokdrww"}

We ended up ordering the pineapple fried rice, and the imperial veggie, and something else I can't remember, and all were super delicious!  \n\nThai Elephant has good food, great prices (1/2 off happy hour appetizers!), and great service.

I went there yesterday and was greeted at the register by the owner who chatted me up for a few minutes and suggested fry dipping combos for me to try, I can't say enough about the staff, great people. \n  Yesterday I had the original and a side of sweet potato fries. The original is a 9 inch (I think) roll with sliced rib-eye, grilled onions, and cheese whiz... holy cow, it was delicious. The meat was tender, not stringy or chewy and had enough flavor to make it through both the cheese and the onions, which were just wonderful icing on the cake. The roll was firm enough to hold up to all the juices, yet was soft and tasted very fresh. The sweet potato fries also blew me away, they were not overly fried by any means, just enough to be hot and steaming and were wonderfully sweet. The owner convinced me to take a side of honey mustard to dip them in, and it was a terrific choice. The dressing added a little sweetness, but the mustard added just enough tang to produce a delightful symphony between the two. Yum. \n  I strongly recommend Forefathers, I have been several times and it is so good each time.

As stated in several other reviews, it really is one of the classer bars in Phoenix, in Arizona, arguably in America and maybe even the world. The tile design as  you enter, the leather couches, the lighting, the faux corinthian pillars, the huge bar in the front room... all just really done well. Some of the clientele can be a bit bouzhy but honestly I find most people here to be quite friendly overall, you just can't assume someone will be a snob because they're well-dressed compared to other venues. The martinis are about the best I've had, and on Monday nights they're $5. I find myself overindulging every time I know I have a Tuesday off (which isn't that often). \nI was dissapointed with the redesign. The back patio, which used to be mellow and upscale with tile floors, a fountain, and a chill vibe, came back to life last year with a 'beach' theme (in Phoenix?) consisting of tequila-bottle lights, a fake plastic shark, and a surfboard. Seriously, what the hell is that? Everyone I know makes fun of it. The dance floor is brightly lit, so that people are too self-conscious out there to use it until it's really late and they're really drunk. Seriously, guys... a $5 dimmer switch would improve that room tenfold.\nStill, it's the best place to go in Phoenix at the beginning of the evening, on the weekends or on Monday nights. Tuesday through Thursday, don't waste your time. Two dead nights and a bad drag show take up the midweek. But for the nightlife in Phoenix on the weekends, it's the best there is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jQt1xMibtitBczJN6LXT1Q"}

Yes, there is actually a large portion of the hike that is FENCED IN - I felt like I was in prison. The only 'breathtaking' part about it is the lethargy I feel when surrounded by ugly urban sprawl & large high rises & too much metal. Sure there is an expansive \"view\" from the top but the view is ugly buildings that were not built to blend in with the landscape. Also parking was impossible. There was actually a giant line of cars just parked & waiting in line for a parking spot in the tiny lot for much much longer than it would take to park somewhere else further and walk to the trailhead...which makes me think that at least some of the people coming here must be kind of idiots or not outdoors very often.\n\nBasically I was really disappointed by Camelback as an opportunity to get out in nature & enjoy the desert.

Overall, I have mixed reviews. The chips were gooooood! Not just corn, but different flavored chips. Yummy. I got a side of guac, which I'll pass on next time. TOOOO many onions for me and not enough salt or lime juice. The owner, as others mentioned, was super nice! Cracked jokes, was friendly, very good service. BUT, when it came to the food, ehhh. I hate ordering take-out and having them eff up your order! I ordered 3 tacos: 1 fish, 1 blackened shrimp, and 1 carne asada, requesting them on corn tortillas with no onions, cilantro, or pico, with extra limes. Got them on flour tortillas with cilantro, with 1 small lime wedge. The fish taco was my least fav. Just tasted like frozen battered cod that was seasoned enough. The shrimp was just ok. The carne asada was great. The meat was very tasty. Also got a side of rice. My whole order (including guac, 3 tacos, and rice) came to $11.16. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed with my food mostly because it wasn't as I ordered it.

Today, I decided to try Sekong's Noumpang Saiko Ang, which is a grilled beef Cambodian sandwich. This sandwich was fabulous! The bread was just the right amount of crispy outside/soft center, the beef was tasty and tender, and the best part, enough mayo that has been so lacking in my previous endeavors. I would say the only thing missing is fresh jalapenos, which I am sure they would add if I request it. Now that this heavenly sandwich has touch my lips, my only hope is that the fresh ingredients remain consistent.

Even if you don't care about craft beer (which would make you weird, sad person), their food is worth the visit.  The pizzas aren't that bad, but they aren't the best option on the menu.

Beginning first with a pliable soft corn tortilla and then stacking on layer after layer of aromatic mushrooms plus a mixture of cheeses both mild and slightly briny this was a dish that greeted the palate well before the tongue and while the top notes of truffle were certainly notable, it was the intensity of the corn smut sauce that really put the it over the top.\n\nQueso Fundido - Duck Barbacoa, Poblano Chile Rajas, Queso Mixto:  Transitioning from the salads and small plates portion of the menu to the tacos, the first to arrive was a DIY affair with rich and unctuous pulled duck meat buried beneath a layer of still bubbling cheese.  Slow cooked and tender with spices including (but certainly not limited to) cumin, oregano, cloves, garlic at the forefront plus plenty of heat from the mixed pepper this was an ample serving to say the least but arriving with plenty of fresh tortillas it didn't even last long enough to cool off completely.\n\nMahi-Mahi - Chipotle Remoulade, Avocado, Red Cabbage, Lime:  Having heard that this was 'the best dish on the menu' by the valet as I parked the car I have to admit I'd probably not have ordered this dish a la carte simply because I've never once had Dolphinfish that wowed me...and that would have been a mistake.  Featuring the mildly flavored fish lightly fried inside a delicate plantain batter the key to this dish was actually the juxtaposition of its accoutrements - the lightly pickled cabbage foiled by the creamy avocado while a light touch of lime brought all the flavors to a point.\n\nCochinita Pibil - Berkshire Pork Shoulder, Achiote, Pineapple BBQ:  For our 'main course' of the evening a large bowl of smoky pork would arrive with an ample description from Michael and with aromatics abound I only wished I had saved more room.  Reportedly roasted for nearly eight hours wrapped in banana leaves and subsequently braised with achiote seeds, oregano, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, sour orange, and more this was the sort of Mexican cuisine we simply don't have back in the Midwest - incredibly complex, nicely nuanced, and literally melt-in-the-mouth tender...the sort of dish that makes me want to explore the region's cuisine more and more.\n\nArroz Con Crema - Creamy Poblano Corn Rice:  Think rice pudding but make it intensely savory with plenty of spice - now make it so rich and texturally refined that all but the best risottos would pale in comparison.  At $5 this is the steal of the menu and I'm disappointed even now that I couldn't eat every bite of the cast iron pot. \n\nEl Fuerte - Flourless Chocolate Cake, Spicy Peanuts, Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse, Vanilla Bean Flan, XO Caramel, Espresso Ice Cream:  Reportedly a dish for two and although I'd have questioned this statement under normal circumstances it was not only enough for two at the end of such a long meal, but after taking my first bite definitely more than one person should rationally eat.  Essentially three squares loosely stacked and topped with GTC Espresso Ice Cream and candied peanuts dusted with chili before a tableside pour of caramel spiked (liberally) with what I believe was Patron XO Caf\u00e9 this was one rich dessert.  Dense on the bottom and light on the top with subtle differences in each bite depending on the various components sampled both Aileen and I worked on this dish slowly and bite after bite it seemed neither of us could stop until I finally threw in the napkin...at least until Aileen left a single bite on the plate and I took the bait, recollected my spoon, and finished it off.\n\nThe Verdict:  While some may piss n' moan that \"Mexican Street Food\" should be served on the streets of Mexico using less esoteric ingredients than Berkshire Pigs, Hudson Valley Ducks, and Black Truffles I'll simply beg to differ and continue my belief that any cuisine can benefit from top quality ingredients in the hands of a skilled and passionate kitchen.  Sure some may question the authenticity of Garces' restaurants or the choice location in a fancy hotel but to those of us who value things like impeccable service, comfortable environs, and the 'experience' of fine dining at a veritable bargain basement price I whole heartedly recommend giving Distrito a look - along with Bayless' Michelin starred Topolobampo it is the best Mexican food I've had to date.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lKQ5hnkSQ-XP80jNCH46nQ"}

Why? because they had it under his new (female, now) name. !!!???  When they finally got that fixed, they handed me 1 inhaler. Trouble is, the original rx from the other pharmacy was for 3 inhalers.

And really didn't!\n\nI was excited to see what was described as an \"izakaya\" style lounge - perhaps my favorite way to enjoy Japanese food -  but let me tell you, this ain't no izakaya.\n\nAn izakaya, by definition, has a certain rustic and friendly feel, catering to drinkers with simple and earthy dishes.  This place is the absolute antithesis of that aesthetic.\n\nWe dropped by for Happy Hour, hoping for an izakaya type experience.  We had four items from the food menu.  They were OK.  The \"izakaya butterfish\"  was three tiny, razor-thin slices of fish - literally smaller and thinner than a slice of gari - for five bucks.  Even at five bucks, it was a rip-off.  Silly, actually.  Perhaps half an ounce of fish if not less.  And this is the \"happy hour\" menu?  The little cheeseburgers were, well, little cheeseburgers.  Modern Steak does a much nicer version with less pretension. The skewered vegies were ok\n\nBasically, their \"izakaya\" menu had a complete absence of actual izakaya dishes.  Sigh.  Just a more pretentious (and much more expensive) version of RA Sushi for people who don't really want to try anything different.  Hence, cheeseburgers.  Does everything in America always have to come down to cheeseburgers? It's sad.\n\nThe design is attractive and very modern but again, not by any stretch of the imagination what most people would identify as an \"izakaya.\"  The concept is not supposed to be to serve little tiny over-priced dishes in an antiseptic atmosphere.  (This is so NOT how Japanese food is supposed to be!)\n\nNeither the staff nor the customers were particularly friendly.  My wife was the only Asian person visible in the restaurant. I think most Japanese people would be simply bewildered by this restaurant's food, style and atmosphere.  It also had that kind of creepy vibe unique to Scottsdale that I can only describe as \"hostile pick up bar,\" a kind of weird combination of sexual energy and animosity.  Ick. (And what's up with that by the way?)\n\nBased on our experience at the bar, I can't really imagine a circumstance where we'd go back.

It's eclectic but it works, mostly. The Mexican blankets covering two of the tables had me scratching my head, considering the attention given to the cool, curly silverware, plates and nifty conversation-starter cards on the tables.\n\nBut I don't go to restaurants for the decor. Reading the menu, I thought the food sounded interesting and a different take on Mexican. Somehow, that this is a vegan restaurant totally slipped by us. I didn't see it on the sign or on the menu. When the waiter told us that anything with \"queso or chorizo\" would be spicy certainly didn't lead me to believe it was vegan. I have nothing against vegan food, but I do like to be told the truth about what I'm getting. The menu has the words \"queso\" and \"chorizo\" on several items and they don't say anything to indicate soy or other faux food products.\n\nWe ordered the Nachos de Cine, tacos with roasted chiles and tacos with mushrooms.  The nachos were an incredible rip-off for the price, which I believe was $7, perhaps more. It was literally a salad-size plate with corn chips that had about three different sauces squeezed on them. I kept expecting a chunk of something or other, but it's so dark in there I could hardly see what I was eating. The only non-sauce things on the plate aside from the chips were two jalepeno slices. $7.00... for real??\n\nThe roasted chile tacos were ok, but the corn tortillas were pretty greasy. The mushroom tacos had the same issue, and I really couldn't find the mushrooms amongst the potatoes and shredded cabbage and more spicy sauce. There were 2 small to average size tacos and no sides for $7. Again, not worth the money.\n\nAs if all this were not enough, our waiter was clueless beyond belief. He was clearly not acquainted with the menu. Although we only ordered 3 food items and one drink, he had to come back and ask again because he couldn't remember what we ordered. When he brought the food to the table he told us he didn't know which was which. He never came to check out how it was.\n\nWhen we were done, he brought the check - which was incorrect. He had forgotten to charge us for the nachos. Even though they were terrible, my boyfriend was concerned that the waiter would be made to pay for the mistake so he pointed it out to him. He had to explain it three times before he understood. Then it took him another 15 minutes to bring back a corrected bill. There were all of 2 tables in there at the time - one was us.\n\nWe saw the woman who from some internet research we presume to be the owner. She never came over to either our table or the other to see how we were enjoying our dinner.  We left feeling like we'd just eaten at a place run by some clueless people \"playing restaurant\". Reporting from the New Times (found after our visit)  of this establishment serving alcohol after hours without a license did nothing to improve our impression of the owner's integrity  either.\n\nWe're always excited to see new eateries in our downtown neighborhood and are happy to support the good ones, but this is not one of them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-UT6IHfVW_2yzz1bf8WI5g"}

However, I never made the leap - until last weekend. My daughter and her fiance raved about Paul, the sushi chef/owner of Yen and told me if I didn't go check it out I would be doing myself a severe disservice. \n\nSince my very dear friend SLR and I had not seen in each other for some time and were ardent sushi fans, I suggested she schlep up to my part of town and meet me at Yen for dinner. Besides....I was paying. When I arrived at the restaurant after an aerobic shopping session, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Paul, the owner, was no other than the Paul I knew from the sushi bar at Takamatsu (a Korean restaurant at 43rd Ave. & Olive).\n\nPaul remembered me and asked about my kids. I told him that my older daughter advised me to come in and now I was especially looking forward to a culinary work-out because Paul is nothing short of amazing. SLR and I arrived at the restaurant at 5pm and didn't leave until 8pm. We enjoyed the dinner, drinks, and company. We never felt rushed or made to feel that we were \"holding up the wheels of progress\" by hanging out for so long.\n\nNot only do I enjoy trying out the standard sushi fare at every restaurant (I'm a dyed-in-the-wool spicy scallop nigiri fan) but also adventurous enough to sample specialties of the house. We ordered the Rainbow Roll, a Caterpillar Roll, some nigiri sushi, and the piece de resistance:  the Palm Springs Roll which is a crab roll covered in a not-too-rich but just-right creamy sauce and small, delicately cut pieces of TOMATOES! I have never seen this particular dish offered at any other sushi venue so I have nothing against which to compare it. I will say, however, that it was FANTASTIC.\n\nThe prices at Yen Sushi and Sake Bar are below average but the food is so far above average that I don't have room enough in this review to expound on the details. Trust me and go to Yen!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Tt6DYs0TyERWHWW5xiRL_A"}

I am apparently in the minority here, but it was a major disappointment from a food standpoint. \n\nWe started with bruscetta which had way too much vinegar to the point where you could barely tell you were eating tomatoes. It was doused with so much oil and vinegar that the bread underneath was soggy within a couple of minutes of sitting there. \n\nI had the espresso rubbed filet Mignon and asked for the \"sauce\" which the waitress said had allot of heat to it to be on the side so I could control the heat. Now, I appreciate some heat in my food and am no wimp but even without the sauce with the heat in it - this fillet had so much heat that I had to take a sip of water after each bite and could barely taste the fillet. It was awful. And the potatoes were slightly undercooked and not hot. \n\nMy husband had the short ribs which he said were OK but not outstanding or even memorable. We chose to skip desert. The presentation of the food was gorgeous, the place itself was cute and our waitress did a good job. It's possible we both just ordered the wrong thing for our tastes - but I'm not inspired to want to drop another $110 based on our experience. Arrowhead Grill in Glendale blows this away for this price point.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FV0BkoGOd3Yu_eJnXY15ZA"}
